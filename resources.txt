Here are some good Resources

#1 C/C++ -> These are an excellent choice for first language as these tells us about how behind the scenes
             computer are working. What a languge is doing? How it is processing the data?
             What is the flow of your program?

            C/C++ are the fastest language out there but the learning curve is quite low. You need to spend
            a good amount of time to these language for getting a some output from it.

        Some facts about the language ->
                     #1 C++ is used for game developement
                     #2  kernels (helps to communicate between software and hardware) is written in C.
                     #3 Any software that requires high graphics usage is 90% C and C++(like your autocad, blender, and much more)
                     #5 Operating systems is made using C/C++
                     #6 Tensorflow(a machine learning library made by the google) is written in C++.

        Resources -> #1 https://www.codesdope.com/cpp-introduction/ = A good website that makes you learn the learn
                        the language efficienty. Beginners will gain a lot from this.

                    #2 For learning the inbuilt data structures present in the STL(standard template library) geeksforgeeks.org is good
                        Just google "data type gfg" like "unordered_map gfg" https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-c-standard-template-library-stl/
                   
                    #3 To learn the advance C++ https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-cpp-20-masterclass/ .
                       This is paid but remember "Programming is free".
                   
                    #4 For specific topics like pointers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M is one of the best. But watch it with
                        full concentration.
                        
#2 Python -> A very simple but enormously powerfull language. From building Machine Learning models to automating your daily taks Python
             got your back. The only limitation of python is that it is REAL SLOW.
            
            Resources ->
                        #1 Python Documentation -> It is very well written keeping beginners in mind. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/
                        #2 Codesdope -> It took you from the ground and familarize you with the language very quickly. And then you can move 
                            to learn about each aspect of the language in details.
                        #3 Geeksforgeeks  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/


#3 Machine Learning -> First we need have a good knowledge of mathematics like(probability, stats, linear algebra and some calculus). Because 
                       machine learning without mathematics is just remebering code. Of course your model will work, but you will never know 
                       why some particular concepts are used in at some situation(like OneHotEncoding in case of categorial data).
                    
                    Resource -> I love the Micromasters course of MIT at edx.org. It is the best in place. Don't buy any course from
                                udemy because you will only remember code and it will be quite a burden.
                                https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science
                                It's free for viewing but to get certificate you have a spend a lot of money, a lot of money.


#4 competitive Programming ->
                    #1 https://cp-algorithms.com/
                    #2 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/competitive-programming-a-complete-guide/
                    #3 shorturl.at/gADI4 (A handbook for competitive programmer)
Other advice:

        1) As a programmer you need to very fluent at keyboard.
            You need to have a good typing speed(50- 60).
            You can learn to type at typing.com and practice at monkeytype.com. Both are free.

        2) Dont' use an IDE in your initial stage. "The IDE will only fascinate you". Prefer using text editor like vscode, sublime text.
            And If you are really good at keybaord prefer(VIM -> it is only controlled by keyboard).
